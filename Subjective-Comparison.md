# IEEE TCSVT 2020 Supplemental Material - Part 2

<p>This page contains results for subjective inspection for the best royalty-free versus non-royalty-free LLFIC solutions comparison scenario considered in the paper titled:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	C. Brites, J. Ascenso, and F. Pereira, “Lenslet Light Field Image Coding: Classifying, Reviewing and Evaluating”, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, February 2020.</em> (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9016088)</p><br/>

The results presented in the page are for two different target bitrates, notably approximately 0.005 and 0.02 bpp, for the MuLE [89] and PMV [90] decoded central PIs.
